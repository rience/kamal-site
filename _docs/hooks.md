# Hooks

You can run custom scripts at specific points with hooks.

Hooks should be stored in the .kamal/hooks folder. Running kamal init will build that folder and add some sample scripts.

You can change their location by setting `hooks_path` in the configuration file.

If the script returns a non-zero exit code the command will be aborted.

`KAMAL_*` environment variables are available to the hooks command (except for `pre-config`) for
fine-grained audit reporting, e.g. for triggering deployment reports or
firing a JSON webhook. These variables include:
- `KAMAL_RECORDED_AT` - UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format, e.g. `2023-04-14T17:07:31Z`
- `KAMAL_PERFORMER` - the local user performing the command (from `whoami`)
- `KAMAL_SERVICE_VERSION` - an abbreviated service and version for use in messages, e.g. app@150b24f
- `KAMAL_VERSION` - the full version being deployed
- `KAMAL_HOSTS` - a comma-separated list of the hosts targeted by the command
- `KAMAL_COMMAND` - The command we are running
- `KAMAL_SUBCOMMAND` - optional: The subcommand we are running
- `KAMAL_DESTINATION` - optional: destination, e.g. "staging"
- `KAMAL_ROLE` - optional: role targeted, e.g. "web"

There are five hooks:

1. pre-config
Called before config file is loaded. This can be used to set environment variables or other configuration later used in config file. It uses default 
(`.kamal/hooks`) directory since it's loaded `hooks_path` is set in the config file. It also does not have `KAMAL_*` environment variables set.

1. pre-connect
Called before taking the deploy lock. For checks that need to run before connecting to remote hosts - e.g. DNS warming.

2. pre-build
Used for pre-build checks - e.g. there are no uncommitted changes or that CI has passed.

3. pre-deploy
For final checks before deploying, e.g. checking CI completed

3. post-deploy - run after a deploy, redeploy or rollback.
This hook is also passed a `KAMAL_RUNTIME` env variable set to the total seconds the deploy took.

This could be used to broadcast a deployment message, or register the new version with an APM.

The command could look something like:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
curl -q -d content="[My App] ${KAMAL_PERFORMER} Rolled back to version ${KAMAL_VERSION}" https://3.basecamp.com/XXXXX/integrations/XXXXX/buckets/XXXXX/chats/XXXXX/lines
```

That'll post a line like the following to a preconfigured chatbot in Basecamp:

```
[My App] [dhh] Rolled back to version d264c4e92470ad1bd18590f04466787262f605de
```

Set `--skip_hooks` to avoid running the hooks.
